# json
JSON provider for LinuxMCE

More and more people want to have access to LinuxMCEs data via JSON. This code provides

a) Access to the MySQL data via filters
b) Access to the router's memory space to get information about now playing and playlist for specific Entertainment Areas. The JSON_Plugin is needed for this to work.
